One day a boy named Tim was playing with his dog, Rex.
Tim threw a ball too far into his neighbor's backyard.
Wanting to retrive the ball, Tim and Rex journeyed into the neighbor's yard.

To his relief, the window was still perfect. Yet he could not find the ball.
“Anybody home?” He got no response. “That’s weird,” Tim thought, 
“the car was still rumbling in the garage, there should be someone in the house.” 
Then he suddenly noticed the wide-open door to the basement. The ball might fall into there. 
As he approached the door, Rex began to howl loudly all of a sudden. 
“Quiet! Rex!” But Rex didn’t seem to stop. Tim smelled something awful, like a corpse.
Though not feeling very well, Tim still decided to see what is in the basement. 
“Rex, Bite him if you see any suspicious guy, OK?”
He knew Rex wouldn’t understand, but that did comfort himself a bit.
“I’m coming in, please, don’t shoot.” His voiced trembled as he entered the dim doorway.
