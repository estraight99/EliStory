One day a boy named Tim was playing with his dog, Rex.
Tim threw a ball too far into his neighbor's backyard.
Wanting to retrive the ball, Tim and Rex journeyed into the neighbor's yard.

To his relief, the window was still perfect. Yet he could not find the ball.
“Anybody home?” He got no response. “That’s weird,” Tim thought, 
“the car was still rumbling in the garage, there should be someone in the house.” 
Then he suddenly noticed the wide-open door to the basement. The ball might fall into there. 
As he approached the door, Rex began to howl loudly all of a sudden. 
“Quiet! Rex!” But Rex didn’t seem to stop. Tim smelled something awful, like a corpse.
Though not feeling very well, Tim still decided to see what is in the basement. 
“Rex, Bite him if you see any suspicious guy, OK?”
He knew Rex wouldn’t understand, but that did comfort himself a bit.
“I’m coming in, please, don’t shoot.” His voiced trembled as he entered the dim doorway.

"See what it is, you might feel better
See what it is, you might feel better
Once you know what's there
You might find you don't need to be scared

The smell in here  gave me such a fright
I couldn't see what it was, it was out of sight
Let's see what it is," he thought

Tim fumbled around the wall until he came up to a light switch.
With a click of the lights, the source of the smell was laid bare.
Burnt meat.
That's what Tim saw, his neighbor looking strangely at an oven.
"Well thanks there, Tim" the man replied. "I wondered why the lights just turned off."
Tim saw his ball by the switch, it must have hit the switch on its way down.
"I burnt my steaks messing with the oven in the dark, but maybe Rex there wants some".
Rex howled, looking delighted, and licking his lips for the delicious meal that ensued.
