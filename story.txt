One day a boy named Tim was playing with his dog, Rex.
Tim threw a ball too far into his neighbor's backyard.
Wanting to retrive the ball, Tim and Rex journeyed into the neighbor's yard.

They sang
"It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood,
So much to do, so much to see,
Won't you retrieve the ball with me?
Retrieve alooong!
Won't you retrieve the ball with me?"
